queso-980922

  o libpcap support for Linux and Solaris ( I think *BSD will work )
    Thanx to Lamont Granquist <lamontg@hitl.washington.edu> 

queso-980916

  o Documentation.txt typos (thanx rodneybrown@pmsc.com)

  o New fingerprints ( HP3000, Unixware 2.1.1, OS/400 ... )

  o minor queso.conf format update: Ack field can be 1 (any), 0 (no ack) 
    and now +num (num == recv.Ack - sent.Seq), or R == Random

queso-980915

  o Fixed paths in Makefile.in by Marc Baudoin <babafou@babafou.eu.org>

  o Some new patterns ( Gandalf, HP/UX 11, Shiva, Ascend, Equinox ... )

  o defined NEEDS_HTONS_IP_LEN for linux, next week i will work hard
    on libpcap stuff and porting to FreeBSD and Solaris.

queso-980903

  o Oooops, configure.in, setup.h.in and tcpip.c definitions about
    ip.ip_csum don't match, fixed. Thanx to  Alexander Frink
    <frink@thep.physik.uni-mainz.de> and  Rafal Maszkowski <rzm@icm.edu.pl>
    
  o New pattern: * IBM XStation 1x0 (by Stefan.Eilemann@dlr.de) 
  
  o New Linux pattern: Because some obscure sendmail behavior,
    it closes listen socket after first SYN. I have tested only on 
    linux and 'fixed' with this pattern.

queso-980902

  o QueSO don't select correct in/out ip since 980827, because 
    'config.h' isn't included in 'tcpip.c' :( , fixed.
    
  o Some patterns.
  
  o Some cosmetic aspects when multiple hosts are scanned.
  
queso-980831

  o Command line now supports multiple hosts, and -p option to select
    default port on all host, except ones with :port
    
  o Changes in configure.in and tcpip.h to be compilable on FreeBSD 
    (don't run ..), patch by Renaud Deraison <deraison@worldnet.fr>
    
  o New patterns in queso.conf (HP-UX 10.20, Sinix, HP-JetDirect, 
    Netware 5.0, etc .. by several contributors )
    
queso-980827

  o Minimal autoconfig support, to simplify the work of debian
    pakage maintainer (Stephane Bortzmeyer <bortzmeyer@pasteur.fr>).

  o Host/mask:port extended again, mask now supports subranges:
    10.1.1.64/24-:80 tests port 80 from 10.1.1.64 to 10.1.1.254,
    10.1.1.60/-24:80 tests port 80 from 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.64

  o Patch from Jerome Alet <alet@unice.fr> :

  o The syntax of hostname_or_IP:port has ben extended to support
    netmask -> hostname_or_ip/netmaskbits:port

  o Patch from Johnny Tevessen <j.tevessen@line.org> :

  o Since queso requires root access to send raw packages, some people
    might install it suid root. This might open security holes (like
    giving people access to a root shell) by some buffer overruns
    in queso. I tried to fix some of these (this includes the buffer
    for the config file name given at the command line which actually
    *was* usuable to get root access).

  o For the same reasons I added some more checks to the file parsing
    routines (config file and /proc/net/*). In a chroot()ed environment,
    /proc could be just anything. Don't dare to parse it, though.

  o Replaced index(), bzero(), and bcopy() by their ANSI counterparts
    strchr(), memset(), and memcopy(), since they are obsolete and not
    as portable as the ANSI functions are.

  o Changed return values to something standardized. Since ANSI C only
    allows return values of 0, EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE, I changed
    it to them. queso should be able to compile under AmigaOS now,
    which uses the value "20" for EXIT_FAILURE, for example, instead
    of the Un*x "1".

  o Removed "text" flag from fopen(). Although it is ignored by
    fopen() anyway, it is not portable and assumed by default.

  o Pre-set some variables to make gcc happy
